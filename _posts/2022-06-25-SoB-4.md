A quick guide on how to use the [`BDK-Kotlin 0.7.0`](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-kotlin) library to create a send transaction with multiple recipients. 
You can use the [`Padawan Wallet`](https://github.com/thunderbiscuit/padawan-wallet) and [`dev-kit`](https://github.com/thunderbiscuit/devkit-wallet/tree/simple-wallet) open-source projects as reference. 

## TxBuilder

Creating a transaction with multiple recipients is trivially easy to do using `BDK-Kotlin`. After you have created a wallet, you can use the `TxBuilder()` object with all the recipient address.

``` kotlin
val faucetAddress1 = "tb1ql7w62elx9ucw4pj5lgw4l028hmuw80sndtntxt"
val faucetAddress2 = "mv4rnyY3Su5gjcDNzbMLKBQkBicCtHUtFB"
val txBuilder = TxBuilder()
	.addRecipient(faucetAddress1, 1000u)
	.addRecipient(faucetAddress2, 1000u)
	.feeRate(1.2f)
val psbt = txBuilder.finish(wallet)
```

All you have to do is to call `.addRecipient(address: String, amount: ULong)` to the `TxBuilder()` builder object. 

### Using lists to create the transaction

The dot notations used on the `TxBuilder` object does not work on the actual object itself, but returns the new `TxBuilder` object.
To elaborate what I mean, here is an example of using a list to add recipients :

``` kotlin
val txBuilder = TxBuilder()
for (recipient in recipientList) {
	 txBuilder.addRecipient(address = recipient.first, amount = recipient.second)
}
txBuilder.feeRate(satPerVbyte = feeRate)
return txBuilder.finish(wallet)
```

In the above, the `TxBuilder` object at the end will not have the recipients nor the fee rate inside, since we are not using the returned `TxBuilder`. 

``` kotlin
var txBuilder = TxBuilder()
for (recipient in recipientList) {
	txBuilder = txBuilder.addRecipient(address = recipient.first, amount = recipient.second)
}
txBuilder = txBuilder.feeRate(satPerVbyte = feeRate)
return txBuilder.finish(wallet)
```

You can write this piece of logic however you want, but to give an example of using scopes to read the `recipientList` data :

``` kotlin 
val psbt = recipientList.fold(TxBuilder()) { builder, recipient ->
    builder.addRecipient(recipient.address, recipient.amount)
}.finish(wallet)
```

## Sign & Broadcast

After you have the `PSBT` object you can do whatever you want with it! Sign and broadcast with the `Wallet` and `Blockchain` object to send out the transaction.
